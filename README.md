UGIS 188: Inquiry 2
===================

This repository sets up a website that will be used for my Inquiry 2 research paper. I will be testing if the design of a survey affects the overall perception of the survey, the user's satisfaction with the survey, or the actual responses received in the survey.

The question that will actually be "surveyed" is "How does the relationship between the content of a meme and its background image affect the funniness of the meme?". Then the users, upon accessing the website, will be rendered one of four possible websites:

- A bland website (default fonts, no colors), difficult user navigation
- A nice website (nice fonts, tasteful colors), difficult user navigation
- A bland website (default fonts, no colors), easy user navigation
- A nice website (nice fonts, tasteful colors), easy user navigation
