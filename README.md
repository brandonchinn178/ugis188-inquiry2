UGIS 188: Inquiry 2
===================

This repository sets up a website that will be used for my Inquiry 2 research paper. I will be testing if the design of a survey affects perception of the survey, the survey's competence, and other aspects of a survey that may affect the results of a survey.

The question that will actually be "surveyed" is "How does the relationship between the content of a meme and its background image affect the funniness of the meme?". Then the users, upon accessing the website, will be rendered one of four possible websites:

- A bland website (default fonts, no colors), difficult user navigation
- A nice website (nice fonts, tasteful colors), difficult user navigation
- A bland website (default fonts, no colors), easy user navigation
- A nice website (nice fonts, tasteful colors), easy user navigation
